Authentication and authorization are 2 seperate items.
Being identified (authentication) doesn't give you the right (authorization).
Authorization usually implies some sort of authentication, or at least a form
of identification, even if identified as anonymous.
A lot of people also consider themselves the subject of authentication. A
network really doesn't care about them, because he can't see, hear or talk to
them. A network only sees a device.
A network can authenticate a device with a certainty between 90% and 99.99%. (I
just came up with that number, there is no science behind it.), but with a
trust level from 0.001% to 99%.
If you have an open wireless network, you can use the mac-address to identify
somebody. There is a very high probability (close to 100%) that this
mac-address uniquely identifies that device.
But it's so very easy to change the mac-address of a wireless device to match
some other device's address. My experience with network device driver writing
is that it is usually much easier to let the user decide the mac-address, than
to write that driver part that pulls it somewhere out of the "hardware".
This makes the trust level of that identification close to 0%.
