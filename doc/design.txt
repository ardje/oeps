OEPS design:
- Open(wrt based) Enterprise *Provisioning* System
I stress provisioning, because it's meant to set up all kinds of networks. The
current focus is mainly wireless networking, but the large part of it is
setting up networks.

ports plugged into a particular soft bridge, and have another of its ports
plugged into another soft bridge.
Usually these ports are wireless networks, but they can be copper ports too.

- Why?
Usually an enterprise has a third party controlling the office automation.
Just making some vlans on existing switches is near impossible in a lot of
organizations. Furthermore: having a wireless network with > 1200 active
clients cannot be handled correctly by most (cheap or expensive) switches
without making sacrifices in the switch configuration.

History:
OEPS is the child of research into an enterprise wireless solution.
It started out with a linksys WRT54G(L) using openvpn to connect to an openvpn tap bridge connected to a firewall. The openvpn and accesspoint did not have any networking functionality i
