--------------------
Short term plans:
--------------------

Broadcast prevention, groupcast bugs circumvention
- Make a mac address update api
  *  Put this on the router to insert static mac entries.
     We can also put timers on the entries that are twice the time of the dhcp
     lease and let the dhcp refresh the arp entries.
  *  Alternative:  creating ebtables entries.
- Finish dhcp parser.
- run it

DMA bugs with ath9k: nbd says try latest trunk

--------------------

Create a third ethernet tunnel:
Always have a br-wifi, br-swifi and copper seperately bridged to the backbone.
This as a preliminary to dynamic setups.
At the backbone we can allow traffic between the different tunnels.
(Like allowing traffic between the copper and swifi part of an accesspoint, to
let appliances like apple-tv work with local clients.)
A second step would be to connect the different "ports" connected to database
generated bridges.
It would allow for a vpn like l2 connection between to sites.
